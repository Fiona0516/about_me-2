### Weekend Work

Grade for work submitted 6/15 AM, https://github.com/vcraig/about_me.git
FIXED 1) The indentation on your html is off which should be fixed.  You should also not leave large chunks of commented out code, it should be deleted.

FIXED 2) CSS. The extra space between the modifiers and the closing brackets shouldn't be there.   

NOT FIXED / Need more explanation
3) On apps.js  You are doing a yes or an everything else response, which isn't bad, but it also isn't quite right for a yes no response quiz.   You may want to modify those.

FIXED 4) The console.log is happening, but it also isn't telling me anything.   It isn't saying information that is helpful.  Just what the user is typing in.   Not complete information like 'the user answered yes to question three.'

FIXED 5) A weird note is that your question 4 is positive affirmative if they say yes or no or anything else.   It is a bit confusing, when I was grading.   But still works.
You did good overall and the functionality is there.   Clean things up a bit and resubmit for full credit.

1. The infinite loop is a problem.   Go ahead and resubmit I know you fixed this yesterday.   Grade is currently a place holder.  I like the new css.

How to DEPLOY (SH)
1. Get your master branch all perfect and stuff.
2. Create a new branch called gh-pages (git checkout -b gh-pages)
3. git push origin gh-pages
4. BOOM. Your site will be at user_name.github.io/repo_name; it is also accessible through a link in the "Settings" tab in your repo
